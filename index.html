    <h2>Why Plastic-Free in India?</h2>
    <div class="mauritius-impact">
        <img src="mauritius-coastline-medium.jpg" alt="Mauritius Beach">
        <p>India, a vast and culturally diverse country, is home to over 1.4 billion people. So, why is India a focal point for significant changes toward sustainability? It’s simple – it’s a necessity. With rapid urbanization and increasing consumption, India is one of the largest producers of plastic waste globally. Co-founders Amar and Aimee recognized the urgent need for change during their travels across the country, witnessing firsthand the environmental impact of plastic waste in both urban and rural areas. India’s rich biodiversity, from its majestic Himalayas to its tropical coasts, is under threat from plastic pollution. However, the country has a long-standing tradition of minimal waste, with practices like reusing and repurposing deeply embedded in its culture. Inspired by India’s age-old sustainable living habits, they believed, "If a country this large can adopt eco-conscious practices, it can inspire global transformation." And thus, Plastic Free Pursuit found its calling in India.</p>

            <p> <b> aim to save 10,000</span> kg of plastic from the environment by 2027!</b></p>

            <p> We aim to save 10,000 kg of plastic from the environment by 2027, contributing to a cleaner and more sustainable future. Through collective efforts, including plastic donations, recycling initiatives, and raising awareness, we hope to significantly reduce plastic pollution and inspire others to adopt eco-friendly practices.</p>

            <h3>2: Community Engagement</h3>
            <p><b> initiatives involve the community, educating them about sustainable practices.</b></p>

            <p> Our initiatives actively engage local communities by organizing workshops, clean-up drives, and educational campaigns that emphasize the importance of sustainable living. We empower individuals with practical knowledge on reducing plastic use, promoting eco-friendly habits, and making environmentally conscious choices in their daily lives.</p>

            <h3>Point 3: Sustainable Alternatives</h3>
            <p><b>promote the use of biodegradable products to replace harmful plastics.</b></p>

            <p>We promote the use of biodegradable products as they break down naturally and return to the earth without leaving harmful residues, unlike conventional plastics which can persist in the environment for centuries. By opting for biodegradable alternatives, we help reduce pollution, protect wildlife, and contribute to a more sustainable, eco-friendly future.</p>
